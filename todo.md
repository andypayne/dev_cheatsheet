# TODO List

This is a random collection of things to try or experiment with.

- [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) - "A powerful and stable keyboard customizer for macOS."
- [ML Flow](https://mlflow.org/) - "An open source platform for the machine learning lifecycle"
- [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) - "The developer-first MLOps platform - Build better models faster with experiment tracking, dataset versioning, and model management"
- [Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/) - "Always know what to expect from your data - Great Expectations is a shared, open standard for data quality. It helps data teams eliminate pipeline debt, through data testing, documentation, and profiling."
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - "A second brain, for you, forever. Obsidian is a powerful knowledge base on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files."
- [mdSilo](https://mdsilo.com/) - "mdSilo is a plain-text knowledge silo and a networked-writing app. - A Knowledge Silo equipped with WYSIWYG Editor and Markdown support, runs entirely in web browser and has Local File System Access ability; it thus functions the same as a native app. Free and Open Source. No registration or installation is required."
- [Typora](https://typora.io/) - "Typora gives you a seamless experience as both a reader and a writer. It removes the preview window, mode switcher, syntax symbols of markdown source code, and all other unnecessary distractions. Instead, it provides a real live preview feature to help you concentrate on the content itself."
